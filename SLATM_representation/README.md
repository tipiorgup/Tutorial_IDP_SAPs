# SLATM Representation Notebook  

`SLATM_generation.ipynb` is a Google Colab notebook for performing a simple **SLATM representation** without requiring an HPC. It utilizes the **QML code** for processing (The QML installaton can be slow).  

## Notes  
- This code generates a representation for just **one snapshot**.  
- It requires the **dictionary `stored_values`** created in the **Simulation Code** and the **`ensembles.pkl`** file (snapshots), both of which are saved automatically during the MD simulation at ***Simulation.ipynb***.
