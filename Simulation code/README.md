`Simulation.ipynb` is a Google Collab notebook for running simple simulations without requiring an HPC. It utilizes the main codes in `src/` and `clean_pair_code.py`.

The interactive notebook depends on `global_vars.py` to create interactive widgets and `traj_process.py` to save final snapshots for further processing.
